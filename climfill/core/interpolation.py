This file gives you the function for filling any missing points
with the spatiotemporal mean of its surrounding points
(interpolation step) and a convenience function for removing points
outside the area of interest (for example, ocean) from the dataset.

    Impute (i.e. Gapfill) data by infilling the spatiotemporal mean for each
    variable independently. A cube of n 5-pixel side length surrounding each
    missing value is taken and the mean of all non-missing values in this
    cube is computed and used to infill the missing value . If a point cannot
    be filled because all the values in the neighbourhood are missing as well,
    the points is filled by the local monthly climatology. Any remaining
    missing points are filled by the local temporal mean, or, if not available,
    the global mean of the variable.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data: xarray dataarray, with coordinates time, latitude, longitude

    Compress data cube by removing all ocean points from the data. The data

    regions, only look at one country, only look at ocean,...)

    Parameters
    ----------
    data: xarray dataarray, coordinates including latitude and longitude

    landmask: boolean xarray dataarray with only the coordinates latitude and
        longitude, where grid points on land are True and grid points in the
