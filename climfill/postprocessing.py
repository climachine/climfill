def to_latlon(data, landmask): 
    """
    Convert 3-dimensional data (variable, landpoints, time) that usually exists
    after gapfilling and unstacking, back to its 4-dimensional shape (variable,
    lat, lon, time) for analysis and final result.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data: xarray dataarray, with dimensions variable, landpoints, time

    landmask: xarray dataarray, boolean, with dimensions lat and lon, where
          values that have been gapfilled (e.g. on land) are set True and
          values that have been ignored for gapfilling (e.g. in the ocean) are
          set to False.

    Returns
    ----------
    tmp: xarray with dimensions variable and time from data and lat, lon from
         landmask, where the landpoints are sorted back to their original
         geographic location
